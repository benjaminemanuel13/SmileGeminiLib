# GeminiLib

**Perfect for Unity**

Simply drop ReDist files into Assets (as plugins) and use *GeminiService* and there you go.

**.Net Usage**

And of course its compatable with any .Net project (its .net Standard 2.1 because I need to use it in Unity).

**Samples**

I'll be adding samples over the next few days.
